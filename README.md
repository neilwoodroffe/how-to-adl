# How to ADL

"How to ADL" is an occupational therapy assessment screening tool that can be used to assess people's capacity to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The tool can also be used and an intervention tool in rehabilitation settings to teach people with disabilities (e.g. mental health, cognitive disorders) how to perform ADL.
